# MagicColors Playground 

MagicColors was proudly developed and awarded a scholarship for WWDC18, showcasing its innovation and educational value. 

MagicColors is designed to engage children by teaching them how to create colors starting from primary colors such as red, blue, and yellow, and exploring various shades by adding white or black.

Upon launching MagicColors, users are greeted with a vibrant home screen filled with colorful balloons and a large play button. Tapping the play button leads them into a playful and interactive playroom environment.

The choice of a playroom setting aims to create a familiar and creative space where children naturally spend much of their time.

MagicColors operates on a drag-and-drop interaction model: the goal is to drag brushes onto the canvas positioned at the center of the room. When a brush is released, if the canvas is empty, it leaves a stain of the brush's color. If the canvas already contains a stain, combining it with the new brush results in a blend, producing a new color stain.

To enhance engagement, all elements within the playroom, including toys and interactions, are animated.

The development was carried out using Xcode on a MacBook, leveraging the UIKit framework for implementing the structure, animations, and gestures.

The visual assets and designs were crafted using an iPad, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive experience for young users.
